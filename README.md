# portfolio
A simple portfolio website built for Code Louisville's Front End Web Development course. For this project, I avoided using front-end frameworks like Bootstrap because I felt it was important to get experience building layouts (for example, the contact modal) from scratch. Using the same reasoning, I used vanilla JavaScript as well as a bit of jQuery so I could practice using both.
