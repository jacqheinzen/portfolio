# portfolio
A simple portfolio website built for Code Louisville's Front End Web Development course. For this project I avoided using Bootstrap, as appealing as it was, because I felt it was important to get experience building layouts from scratch. In my .js file, I used some vanilla JavaScript and some jQuery to practice using both.
